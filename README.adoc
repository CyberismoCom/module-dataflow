== About the Cyberismo dataflow module

The Cyberismo dataflow module defines card types and link types for creating dataflow models with processes, external entities, data storages, trust boundaries and data flows.

You can use this module as an example of the visualisation capabilities. For threat modelling and architecture diagrams, we recommend using the Cyberismo secure development essentials module instead. See https://docs.cyberismo.com/cards/docs_8mywsysm.html[Threat modelling tutorial in Cyberismo documentation] for more information.
